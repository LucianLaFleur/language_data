A collection of resources for language learning

### For All Languages ---

- Organizing a more meaningful study-path
Single words and dry definitions are garbage for studying; everything MUST be informative and well-structured to convey a clear meaning of a target.
A target for a given sentence is what the student is intended to learn by practicing it. 
Sentences need to be organized in such a manner that makes the overall structure appropriate for their level while consistently introducing them to new material.
To achieve this balance, I use reference lists to prioritize terms and grammar concepts in relative orders of difficulty (this is my square-1 starting point for any language) 

### Japanese ---

- the JPNT "N" system
In the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) there are 5 tiers, which I'll roughly sum up as:/
N5: very basic (and probably not able to string together a sentence)
N4: simple (can put together a sentence, but in very limited context)
N3: lower conversational (can have whole conversations about simple concepts)
N2: Business conversational (can have a wide array of conversations with minimal error)
N1: Advanced (Like a pro-translator ; May Kami-sama have mercy on your soul, this is a crazy milestone for a foreigner to reach)

My references in naming files use the appropriate N-level when they kind of approximate to that complexity. 
There are no "official" lists, but this is a ballpark guess of going from simpler things to harder concepts. 

Japanese has 3 main study categories: Vocabulary, Grammar, and Kanji
- Japanese Vocab
You will see a n# with Vocab as well as Kanji for each N-tier.
Some vocab uses hard kanji that you shouldn't be worried about learning at that level. 
Some kanji may be simpler, but it's appropriate to learn somewhat obscure terms that employ those characters.
In my example sentences, I try to balance vocab and Kanji exposure, using cloze deletions to imply what should be focused on. It's hard for students to know what they should be focused on memorizing without some guidance; I only occlude kanji when they are supposed to be written, for example.
I assume when a kanji is hidden that the user is practicing trying to write the hidden kanji, thus the element of writing practice is involves, whilst not being explicit.

- Japanese Grammar

For beginners, the n5Grammar list will get you started with grammar
I then there's a master list grammarConceptCollection.txt. 
grammarConceptCollection.txt is ordered from easy to hard, but not in a point-by-point fashion based off the most used to the most obscure grammar. Admittedly, I lack a resource that has such an ordering./

- Japanese Kanji
Although I try to balance kanji associated with each level in the N-tier system, I have 2 extra lists:

- joyoukanji full - the common-use kanji, which are considered common knowledge for fluency

- 10k kanji based on simplicity - an expanded list of a lot of kanji including many obscure items for advanced study
